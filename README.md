> **The Agentic Framework for Autonomous Data Cleaning and Smart ETL**

**bReliant** (/rəˈlīənt/) is a robust, steps-based Python framework designed to build the next generation of intelligent data pipelines. We provide the stable, validated foundation that **AI Agents** need to navigate complex data tasks with 100% reliability.

## The Philosophy
**re·li·ant**  
*/adjective/*: dependent on someone or something.  
*"The company is heavily reliant on clean data for its AI to function."*

In the era of autonomous software, your business is only as strong as the data it depends on. We built **bReliant** so that developers and enterprises can be **reliant** on their data infrastructure. We provide the "guardrails" for AI, ensuring that as your pipelines become more agentic, they remain predictable, observable, and secure.

## Why bReliant?

### 1. Agentic-Ready Architecture
Most ETL tools are rigid. bReliant is built for **Smart ETL**. Its modular "Step" design allows LLMs and AI Agents to dynamically assemble and execute data cleaning tasks without breaking the system.

### 2. Autonomous Data Integrity
Using **Pydantic** for strong typing and validation, bReliant ensures that your data is always structured. If a "Smart Step" encounters an anomaly, the framework's self-healing properties and rigorous validation keep the pipeline on track.

### 3. Industry Adaptive
Whether you are in healthcare, real estate, or finance, bReliant adapts to your industry's specific demands. It’s not just a cleaner; it’s a mission-critical foundation you can depend on.

### 4. Integration Over Competition
bReliant isn't an orchestrator like Airflow or Prefect—it's the **engine** that sits inside them. It makes your individual tasks more robust, repeatable, and maintainable.

## Core Components

*   **Steps**: Small, manageable units of work that are easily tested and reused.
*   **Context**: A flexible environment for customizing task behavior on the fly.
*   **Smart Loggers**: Full transparency and traceability for every data movement.
